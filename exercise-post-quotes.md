# In-class exercise: Allow adding of new quotes via POST

**Objective:** change a quote API server to allow POSTs of new quotes.

The route should be `/quotes` and the HTTP method should be POST.

Note: You should use [OUR starting project: cyf-quotes-post-start](https://glitch.com/~cyf-quotes-post-start), NOT your own existing quote server. This is because our project has an HTML form for creating new quotes.

You should refer to the [official Express documentation on req.body](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.body) to help you with this.

## When you are finished
When you are finished, DM your URL via Slack to someone sitting next to you and they must test if your API works!

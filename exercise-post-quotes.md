# In-class exercise: Allow adding of new quotes via POST

**Objective:** change a quote API server to allow POSTs of new quotes.

The route should be /quotes and the method should be POST.

You can use the [official documentation on req.body](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.body) to help you with this.

Note: You should use [OUR starting project](TODO), NOT your own existing quote server. This is because our project has an html form for creating new quotes.

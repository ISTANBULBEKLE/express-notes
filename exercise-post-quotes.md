# Exercise: Allow adding of new quotes via POST (5-15 minutes)

**Objective:** change a quote API server to allow POSTs of new quotes.

The route should be `/quotes` and the HTTP method should be POST.

Note: You should use [OUR starting project: cyf-quotes-post-start](https://glitch.com/~cyf-quotes-post-start), NOT your own existing quote server.  This is because our project has an HTML form for creating new quotes.

When you remix our starting project, immediately rename it as `cyf-mussie-quotes-v2` but change it for YOUR name.

## Getting help

You should refer to the [official Express documentation on req.body](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.body) to help you with this.

## When you are finished
* When you are finished, DM your URL via Slack to someone sitting next to you and they must test if your API works!
